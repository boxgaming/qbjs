# About QBJS

​A web-based implementation of the classic BASIC programming language, bringing QBasic-style coding to modern web browsers.

- **BASIC for the web:**  
  QBJS implements the Basic programming language (specifically the QBasic dialect) so you can write, run, and share BASIC programs directly in your browser.
  
- **QB64 compatibility:**  
  It aims to be compatible with QB64, which itself is an extended implementation of classic Microsoft QBasic. Many BASIC programs written for those platforms will work in QBJS.
  
- **Multimedia and browser support:**  
  The project includes support for multimedia features and integrates with web browser APIs, allowing programs to interact with HTML5, graphics, input, and more.
  
- **Online IDE:**  
  On [QBJS.org](https://qbjs.org)​, you can open an interactive BASIC IDE in the browser, write source code, and run it without installing anything.
  
- **Game Engine:**  
  QBJS provides built-in support for the [GX game engine](https://github.com/boxgaming/gx)​.
  
- **Samples:**  
  There is a large and growing collection of sample BASIC programs to demonstrate graphics, demos, and simple games:

  **Subproject QBJS_mobile:**
  There is a Subproject called QBJS_mobile where QBJS is made mobile friendly:

In short, QBJS lets you write classic BASIC programs that run in the browser, combining the simplicity of QBasic with modern web platform capabilities — like graphics and sharing — all without needing a native compiler or separate environment.
